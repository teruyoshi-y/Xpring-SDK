# Xpring SDK 

XRP SDK is a set of libraries and services designed by Xpring to make interaction with the XRP Ledger as easy as possible. XRP SDK works consistently across languages and platforms to create a cohesive development experience with XRP, regardless of the language, platform, or environment you are building your app in. 

## Libraries

- [Xpring-JS](http://github.com/xpring-eng/xpring-js): A JavaScript SDK.
- [XpringKit](http://github.com/xpring-eng/xpringkit): A Swift SDK

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Xpring SDK is available in the following languages:
- [XpringKit](https://github.com/xpring-eng/xpringkit): Swift SDK
- [Xpring-JS](https://github.com/xpring-eng/xpring-js): JavaScript SDK

### Server Side Component
The server side component sends client-side requests to an XRP Node. 

To get developers started right away, Xpring currently provides the server side component as a hosted service, which proxies requests from client side libraries to an XRP Node. Developers can reach the endpoint here: 
grpc.xpring.tech:80

Xpring is working on building a zero-config way for XRP node users to deploy and use the adapter as an open-source component of [rippled](https://github.com/ripple/rippled). Watch this space!

## Roadmap

Over time Xpring will work with the community, developers, and partners in order to expand the feature set to fulfill the needs of apps in the ecosystem. Xpring also will expand support to additional languages and platforms in the near future.
